### Functionality available on GPU
- Spin dynamics measurement phase
- Tensorial exchange and single site anisotropy Hamiltonians
- The Depondt solver for the SLLG
- Copying of state variables back to CPU memory for measurements

### To GPU, high priority

- Measurements of magnetization m and energy E
- Initial phase
- Metropolis Monte Carlo
- Heat-bath Monte Carlo
- J-tensor support to Metropolis and Heat-bath MC
- Calculation of dipole-dipole interaction using the FFT method.
  - Implementations for both the FFT MKL and FFTW libraries
  - Implementations for HeFFTe libraries for heterogeneous architectures
  - Added capabilities to treat open boundaries conditions.

### To GPU, medium priority

- Spin-lattice dynamics (SLD)
- Spin-transfer torque (STT)
- Symplectic solvers
- multiscale (muASD) functionalities.
- Non-local damping
- Introduced **major new feature**, 3 Temperature model:
  - Added electron-only mode for 3TM.
  - Added variable specific heats for 3TM
  - Added 3TM example: `./SLDexamples/bccFe3TM`.
- Weights to cumulants to improve convergence.
- New function for real-space and time correlations.
- Triangulation routine for skyrmion number calculation.
- JSON output for cumulant data (for aiida-uppasd parsing).
- Minimal driver routines for ASD and MC for external use.
- Velocity correlations.
- Frequency convolution for S(q,w) (earlier only for DOS).
- Support for averaging of S(q,w)
- Calculation of the scalar S(q,w) scattering intensity.
- Cross-correlations: spin-displacement and displacement-velocity.
- Quantum Heath Bath Method
- [Dipole-dipole interaction via the macro-cell model](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/28/6/066001/meta).
  - The capability of reading and writing the dipole-dipole tensor for both the macro dipole and brute force dipole interactions, which could be used to improve the speed of some calculations.
    - The capacity to write the dipolar fields in certain cells  produced by all the other cells. This should allow for a multi-scale approach, where the region of interest is studied with the full dipole-dipole interaction plus the far field contribution.
- Wang-Landau implementation introduced.

### To GPU, lower priority

- Temperature gradients
- Local field pulses
- Local temperature pulses
- Variant of induced moment treatment implemented.
- Metatype concept for projected correlations.
- ASD functionality to ip_mode SX.
- Topological center of mass as an observable
- Local angular momentum measurable for atoms (local frame).
- Temperature control to LSWT correlation functions.
- Polesya's original formulation for induced moments.
- Four-site ring exchange routines
- Rudimentary parallel tempering algorithm
- `do_bls_local_axis B` for correlations perpendicular to the local B-field.
- Capability for induced moment calculation is SD mode.
  - The calculation is based on the approach by Polseya and it treats the induced magnetic moments motion as being slaved by the motion of the nearest neighbour fixed moments.
  - Introduced a new array which contains whether a moment is induced or not while taking into account the chemical nature of the system.
  - Currently this type of dynamics is only taken into account in the Depondt solver.
  - Added the capability of having fixed moments and induced moments at the same time.
  - The selective Depondt solver will only update spins that 1) Are not induced 2) Are not fixed.
  - The magnitude and direction of the induced moments depends on the neighbouring fixed moments. This might cause problems at high temperatures.
- Added the generalized form for the SOT.
  - There are parameters controlling the damping-like torque and the field-like torque.
  - The sign of the parameters might still be in question.
  - There is also possibility for site dependent spin polarizations.
  - Geodesic nudged elastic band (GNEB) functionality.

- SLD regressions tests.
- Support for `do_reduced Y` to NC-AMS.
- Makefile for win64 (cross-platform build).
