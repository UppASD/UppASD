Square lattice two atom basis

Input files to set up spin-lattice dynamics simluations of a
square lattice with two atom basis
In phonfile the two atoms have the same mass
In phonfilem1m2 the mass of atom 2 is double the mass of atom 1.
For the case of phonfilem1m2, the calculated phonon dispersion along
high symmetry directions \Gamma-X-M-\Gamma matches with the results
for shown on slide no 10 in the lecture notes by
Farhan Rana for ECE 407, Spring 2009, Cornell University

Input files are available in two variants, with/without symmetry
to set up the Hamiltonians.
