Examples of input parameters and phonon dispersions for harmonic lattice potential

Model potentials: nearest and next nearest neighbor coupling for simple structures.
See README in the respective directory.

honeycomb
square
squareB2
triangular

DFT based potentials: constructed with data from VASP and Phonopy calculations.
Each example contains a subdirectory with VASP and Phonopy input, and selected
output, and a subdirectory with UppASD input files.

bccFe
bto
diamond
graphene
polonium

Utiliary program: used to generate from a Phonopy FORCE_CONSTANTS file an UppASD llfile.

llfileindex.f90     the program
llfileindex.dat     input parameter, edit to match the size of the Phonopy supercell
