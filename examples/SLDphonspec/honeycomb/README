Honeycomb lattice

Input files to set up spin-lattice dynamics simulations of a
honeycomb lattice
In phonfile the two atoms have the same mass.
In phonfilem1m2 the mass of atom 1 is double the mass of atom 2.
The calculated phonon dispersion along
high symmetry directions \Gamma-M-K-\Gamma matches with the results
on Figs. 6 and 7 respectively in Cserti and Tichy Eur. J. Phys. 25, 723 (2004)

Input files are available in different variants, with/without symmetry,
for direct/Cartesian coordinate, and for maptype 1 or 2. Currently working variants are

Base
A120Base

currently non-working variants

A60Base          (check and correct the direct q points for 60 deg lattice vectors)
BaseCartNoSym    (check and correct the entries in the llfile)
