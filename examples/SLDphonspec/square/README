Square lattice

Input files to set up spin-lattice dynamics simulations of a
square lattice

The llfile files are available in two variants

llfile    with nearest neighbor coupling
llfileN2  with second nearest neighbor coupling

For the latter, the calculated phonon dispersion along
high symmetry directions \Gamma-X-M-\Gamma matches with the results
on Fig. 11 in Cserti and Tichy Eur. J. Phys. 25, 723 (2004)
