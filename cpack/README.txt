Uppsala Atomistic Spin Dynamics software
https://github.com/UppASD/UppASD

The UppASD software package is a simulation suite to study magnetization dynamics by means of the atomistic version of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation.

Applications:
Critical temperature determination
Magnon spectra simulations
Micromagnetic exchange and DMI stiffness calculations
Current, field, and temperature-driven dynamics

Features:
LLG, Metropolis, and Heat-bath algorithms
Generalized Hamiltonian including
bilinear and biquadratic Heisenberg exchange
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange
magnetocrystalline anisotropies.
Support for arbitrary crystal structures and random alloys
Spin-transfer and spin-orbit torques
Temperature gradients
Quantum statistics
