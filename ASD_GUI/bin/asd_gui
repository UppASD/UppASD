""" @package ASD_GUI
Main executable for the UppASD GUI. The GUI is designed to allow for
pre-processing and post-processing activities with ease.
The GUI has the following capabilities
    - VTK Visualization:
        - Restart files (Final snapshot of a simulation)
        - Moment files (Animation/video rendering of the data)
            - If one has a KMC file one can see the movement of the KMC
            particles.
            - If there is a cluster file one can see the location of the
            impurity cluster atoms.
        - Neighbour setup
            - Allows to see the Heisenberg exchange neighbours in real space,
            with colormapping
            being determined by the magnitude of the interactions.
            - Plot the DMI vectors between neighbours, with the colormap being
            determined
            by the magnitude of the vectors.
        - Site dependent energy, allowing for time-dependent rendering.
        - It also includes several general actors, such a colorbars, axes and
        time step visualization
        - It allows for on the fly modification of the glyphs for the
        magnetization, visualization of the magnetization density.
        - On the fly change of the size of the magnetization glyphs.
    - Matplotlib Plots:
        - Spin-spin correlation function.
            - Plots the colormap when the dynamical correlation function is
            used.
            - Plot the AMS obtained from linear spin wave theory.
        - Magnetization averages.
            - One can turn on/off component at will.
        - Single atom  trajectories in the unit sphere.
    - Input file generation
        - One can setup the basic features to create the inpsd.dat
        - Visual creation of the posfile and momfile
        - Creation of magnetic configurations for the restarfiles
            - Domain walls.
            - Skyrmions.
            - Helical spin spirals.
